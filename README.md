# Network-average-connectivity-counter
This code compares the average connectivity of a target gene list in a defined edge-file to random genes in the human genome. The comparison uses an numerical p-value at the standard of 0.01 if the target genes have a high average connectivity, on average, within a brain subnetwork than random genes.
